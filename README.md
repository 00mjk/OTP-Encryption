OTP-Encryption
=====================

A small encryption/decryption program that utilises one-time pads.

Background
=====================

As a quick search on Wikipedia will tell you "the one-time pad (OTP) is a type of encryption that is impossible to crack if used correctly. Each bit or character from the plaintext is encrypted by a modular addition with a bit or character from a secret random key (or pad) of the same length as the plaintext, resulting in a ciphertext. If the key is truly random, at least as long as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and kept secret, the ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break without knowing the key".

Purpose
=====================

The purpose of this project is to create a program that is simple to use (though making the one time pad truly secure [read random] is arguably no trivial matter), reliable and most importantly trustworthy and available for everyone.

As you can probably see from the code, I am no professional programmer, but I think the code makes fair use of the OTP concept. I do however, having looked at other projects out there, believ there is much left to do before it can be called a good program. 

How can you help?
=====================

You can contribute by using your expertise to perfect this little program, help ironing out and correcting any mistakes I may have made.

Ideally, the program should have improved treatment of the key and source files so as to leave as few traces of their existance as possible, but I'm afraid this is as far as my programming abilities take me.

Thank you!
